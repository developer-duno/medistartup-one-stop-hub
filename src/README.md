## Runware API Integration

To use the AI-generated hospital images, you need to:
1. Create an account at https://runware.ai/
2. Obtain your API key from the dashboard
3. Replace '6PtVhh4UUUKazd3Uv8K0l7njZsxeaOxQ' in the HeroSection component with your actual API key

Alternatively, you can provide the API key through an environment variable.
